You can keep following links to fascinating articles from here!</p>\n<p>I also love <a href=\"https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki\">Martin Fowler's bliki</a> which is something very similar - a combination blog and wiki.  <a href=\"https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/WhatIsaBliki.html\">Martin writes</a> \"I decided I wanted something that was a cross between a wiki and a blog - which Ward Cunningham immediately dubbed a bliki. Like a blog, it allows me to post short thoughts when I have them. Like a wiki it will build up a body of cross-linked pieces that I hope will still be interesting in a year's time.\"</p>\n<p>So I took my personal diary, and turned it into a bliki-style digitial garden.  It has blog-like posts with dates and chronological order, and it has random wiki-like pages.</p>\n<p>It also has a quite flat organisational hierarchies.  I don't like deep hierarchies - they get messy fast!  But I decided to have two basic levels - <strong>Categories</strong> are a single top-level way to split all the content - in my diary it's basic things like \"work\", \"home\", \"play\" and similar.</p>\n<p>And then I have <strong>tags</strong> for everything else.  All posts get a bunch of tags, sometimes at random and inconsistently - every now and then I look at low-usage tags and clean them up a bit.</p>\n<p>The private site is very private - it has personal notes, diary entries, work feedback - otherwise I'd share it as it's a better example of how this works than this demo site!</p>\n<p>Maybe some time I'll move my real blog to this platform.  If I think it's working!</p>","tableOfContents":""},"asciidoc":null},"pageContext":{"kind":"markdown","slug":"/wiki/garden/","title":"What is a digital garden?","tags":["website","wiki","meta"],"category":"docs","date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","selectedTag":"website","selectedCategory":"docs"}}}
