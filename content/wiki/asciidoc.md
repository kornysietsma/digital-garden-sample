I had Asciidoc support here, but it just complicted scripts and most plugins didn't work, so I've removed it.  If you need it, it's in [git history](https://github.com/kornysietsma/digital-garden-sample/tree/07c3664fcf2c1c1cebb830dbf740e4289d287457)

Things that used to work:
* basic syntax
* tables, mostly - but it seemed the JavaScript Asciidoctor clone wasn't 100% right

Things that didn't work properly and looked like a lot of work:
* source code syntax
* diagrams
* nice inline images
