The garden - and I may be misusing the term, it's all a bit new to me - is a place where your information resides - it's not necessarily time-based like a blog, it's also a network of information, more like a wiki.

There's a good description at <https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden> - which I found from browsing the gatsby sample at <https://github.com/johno/digital-garden> - both of those link to the earlier articles [Building a digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/) and [Of gardens and wikis](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) by Tom Critchlow.  You can keep following links to fascinating articles from here!

I also love [Martin Fowler's bliki](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki) which is something very similar - a combination blog and wiki.  [Martin writes](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/WhatIsaBliki.html) "I decided I wanted something that was a cross between a wiki and a blog - which Ward Cunningham immediately dubbed a bliki. Like a blog, it allows me to post short thoughts when I have them. Like a wiki it will build up a body of cross-linked pieces that I hope will still be interesting in a year's time."

So I took my personal diary, and turned it into a bliki-style digitial garden.  It has blog-like posts with dates and chronological order, and it has random wiki-like pages.

It also has a quite flat organisational hierarchies.  I don't like deep hierarchies - they get messy fast!  But I decided to have two basic levels - **Categories** are a single top-level way to split all the content - in my diary it's basic things like "work", "home", "play" and similar.

And then I have **tags** for everything else.  All posts get a bunch of tags, sometimes at random and inconsistently - every now and then I look at low-usage tags and clean them up a bit.

The private site is very private - it has personal notes, diary entries, work feedback - otherwise I'd share it as it's a better example of how this works than this demo site!

Maybe some time I'll move my real blog to this platform.  If I think it's working!
