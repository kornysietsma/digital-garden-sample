# Korny's Gatsby Garden Sample

This is a demo of building a "digital garden" using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

It's not a fully featured sample that you can use as-is - but it might be handy for people doing similar things.

There will be a published version of this soon where I will add more context!  Take a look there rather than relying on this readme for details...

This project is based on the default gatsby starter as used in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) - have a look there if you want more details on how this works.
